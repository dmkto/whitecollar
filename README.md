## White Collar - A Jekyll Theme

Started off with the [Flexton Theme by Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexton).

Slapped [Buddyboss's Wordpress theme](https://www.buddyboss.com/website-platform/) onto it, particularly the Post layout.

The result? A clean text-focused Jekyll theme for quickly jotting down ideas!
